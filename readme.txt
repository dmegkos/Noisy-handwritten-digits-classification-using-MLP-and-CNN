A Comparison of MLP and CNN in Predicting Noisy Handwritten Digits

Dimitrios Megkos - 210034034 - dimitrios.megkos@city.ac.uk

Python version: 3.9.7
Dependencies: Numpy, Torch, TorchVision, Seaborn, Matplotlib.pyplot
The two .py files containing NN Classes and the custom functions along
with the four .pth files must be placed in the same folder with the Notebooks.



Instructions:

If you want to just test the best trained models, open the "Test_Models.ipynb" notebook
and run the cells.

To see the whole process, open the "DM_CW_Notebook.ipynb" notebook.



Please note!!

If you choose to run the whole notebook again, the training and validation part of each algorithm
takes some time (15-20 minutes for all functions, depending on the choice of hyperparameters).

Thank you for running my code!
